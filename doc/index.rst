Introduction
````````````

Andor Technology manufactuer offers a large catalogue of scientific cameras. Covered scientific applications are low ligth imaging, spectroscopy, microscopy, time-resolved and high energy detection.
Andor is providing a Software Development Tool (SDK) for both Windows and Linux, supporting different interface buses such as USB, CameraLink and also some specific acquisition PCI board. Unfortunately there was a significant API change between the v2 line of SDK and the brand new v3 of the SDK, and recent cameras are only supported by the v3 SDK, whilst this new SDK is not (yet ?) supporting previously built cameras.

The Lima module has been tested only with these camera models:

  - Neo (sCMOS 3-tap, full Camera Link, Linux OS)
  - Zyla (5.5 sCMOS, full Camera Link, Linux OS)

Installation & Module configuration
```````````````````````````````````

First, you have to install the Andor SDK the default path (/usr/local).
For our test we used the SDK for Linux version **V3.3.30004.0** and ran the install script ``install_andor`` for which option 2 (64b linux) was selected, the default installation is made under ``/usr/local/`` with:

  - ``/usr/local/include``, header files
  - ``/usr/local/lib``, library files
  - ``/usr/local/andor/bitflow``, files for the frame-grabber driver (including camera firmware/frame grabber configuration)

The Linux SDK 3.3 has shared libraries which has been compiled on recent linux kernel, check first you have the right kernel and
libc available by compiling one of the example program available under ``examples/console``.
Andor3 python module needs at least the lima core module.

The best before using this Lima pluggin with a Andor Neo camera is to test the proper setting of the frame-grabber driver and system configuration by
using the two test programs included in the SDK. Those are typically found in ``/usr/local/andor/examples/`` and are ``listdevices`` and ``image``.

Then, follow the generic instructions in :ref:`build_installation`. If using CMake directly, add the following flag:

.. code-block:: sh

  -DLIMACAMERA_ANDOR3=true

For the Tango server installation, refers to :ref:`tango_installation`.

Configuration
`````````````

Connect the camera on both cameralink cables and power on.

How to use

A simple python test programm:

.. code-block:: python

  from Lima import Andor
  from lima import Core

  # -------------------+--------------------------------------------+
  #                    |                                            |
  #                    v camlink config path                        v camera index
  cam = Andor3.Camera('/users/blissadm/local/Andor3/andor/bitflow', 0)
  hwint = Andor3.Interface(cam)
  ct = Core.CtControl(hwint)

  acq = ct.acquisition()

  # configure some hw parameters
  hwint.setTemperatureSP(-30)
  hwint.setCooler(True)
  .... wait here for cooling

  # set some low level configuration

  hwint.setCooler(True)
  hwint.setTemperatureSP(-55)
  hwint.setFanSpeed(cam.Low)
  hwint.setAdcGain(cam.b11_low_gain)
  hwint.setAdcRate(cam.MHz100)
  hwint.setElectronicShutterMode(cam.Rolling)
  hwint.setOverlap(False)

  # setting new file parameters and autosaving mode
  saving=ct.saving()

  pars=saving.getParameters()
  pars.directory='/buffer/lcb18012/opisg/test_lima'
  pars.prefix='test1_'
  pars.suffix='.edf'
  pars.fileFormat=Core.CtSaving.EDF
  pars.savingMode=Core.CtSaving.AutoFrame
  saving.setParameters(pars)

  # set accumulation mode

  acq_pars= acq.getPars()

  #0-normal,1-concatenation,2-accumu
  acq_pars.acqMode = 2
  acq_pars.accMaxExpoTime = 0.05
  acq_pars.acqExpoTime =1
  acq_pars.acqNbFrames = 1

  acq.setPars(acq_pars)
  # here we should have 21 accumulated images per frame
  print acq.getAccNbFrames()

  # now ask for 2 sec. exposure and 10 frames
  acq.setAcqExpoTime(2)
  acq.setNbImages(10)

  ct.prepareAcq()
  ct.startAcq()

  # wait for last image (#9) ready
  lastimg = ct.getStatus().ImageCounters.LastImageReady
  while lastimg !=9:
    time.sleep(1)
    lastimg = ct.getStatus().ImageCounters.LastImageReady

  # read the first image
  im0 = ct.ReadImage(0)
